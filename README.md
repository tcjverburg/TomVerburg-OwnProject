# TomVerburg-OwnProject
## Application which lets the user search for newsarticles from The Guardian using their live API.

This application makes it possible to create an account using Firebase, add articles to a list of favorite articles and remove them,
search for articles, read articles and see their own search history. The favorites are saved using shared preferences
and the search history is saved using a Firebase realtime database.
